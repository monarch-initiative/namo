## General Curation Principles

### Universal Best Practices

1. **Start with Paper Structure**
   - **Abstract**: Identifies model type and key innovation
   - **Methods**: Technical protocols and parameters  
   - **Results**: Performance data and validation
   - **Discussion**: Context and limitations

2. **Schema Mapping**
   - Use appropriate ontology IDs (UBERON for anatomy, CL for cell types)
   - Ensure controlled vocabulary compliance
   - Check enum values against schema definitions
   - Validate required fields for each model class

3. **Technical Accuracy**
   - Extract quantitative measurements and performance metrics
   - Capture innovation and unique features
   - Document validation approaches and results
   - Include comprehensive literature references

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run `just test` to ensure YAML validates
   - Verify all required fields are complete
   - Check enum values are correct
   - Test against the schema after curation

## Model Type Decision Tree

```
Is it a microfluidic device?
â”œâ”€ Yes: Use OrganOnChip or TissueOnChip guide
â”‚   â”œâ”€ Focus on organ physiology â†’ OrganOnChip
â”‚   â””â”€ Focus on tissue function â†’ TissueOnChip
â””â”€ No: Is it self-organizing from stem cells?
    â”œâ”€ Yes: Use Organoid guide
    â””â”€ No: Consider other NAM model types
        â”œâ”€ 3D cell culture without microfluidics â†’ ThreeDCellCulture
        â”œâ”€ Computational model â†’ MLModel, QSARModel, etc.
        â””â”€ Animal model â†’ AnimalModel
```

## Schema Classes Summary

| Model Class | Abstract? | Key Features | Required Fields |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| `Organoid` | No | Self-organizing, stem cell-derived | `organ_modeled`, `cell_source` |
| `OrganOnChip` | No | Microfluidic, organ physiology | `organ_modeled`, `microfluidic_design` |
| `TissueOnChip` | No | Microfluidic, tissue function | `tissue_modeled`, `microfluidic_design` |
| `MicrophysiologicalSystem` | **Yes** | Use concrete subclasses above | N/A |
| `ThreeDCellCulture` | No | 3D without microfluidics | `three_d_architecture` |

## Common Enum Values

### Complexity Levels
- `LOW`: Simple, single-parameter models
- `MODERATE`: Multi-parameter with some interactions  
- `HIGH`: Complex, multi-system interactions

### Architecture Types  
- **Microfluidic**: `SINGLE_CHANNEL`, `MULTI_CHANNEL`, `LAYERED`
- **3D Culture**: `SPHEROID`, `SCAFFOLD_BASED`, `HYDROGEL_EMBEDDED`

### Flow Control
- `SYRINGE_PUMP`, `PRESSURE_DRIVEN`, `GRAVITY_DRIVEN`, `PERISTALTIC_PUMP`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Validation Errors

1. **Unknown enum code**: Check schema for valid enum values
2. **Missing required field**: Add mandatory fields for model class
3. **Invalid class name**: Use concrete classes, not abstract ones
4. **Incorrect file naming**: Use `ClassName-example-ID.yaml` format

### Getting Help

- Check existing examples in `tests/data/valid/`
- Validate with `just test` after changes
- Review schema definitions in `src/namo/schema/namo.yaml`
- Consult class-specific guides for detailed instructions
