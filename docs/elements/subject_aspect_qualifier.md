# Slot: subject_aspect_qualifier 


_Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the core concept.  The purpose of the aspect slot is to indicate what aspect is being affected in an 'affects' association.  This qualifier specifies a change in the subject of an association (aka: statement)._
