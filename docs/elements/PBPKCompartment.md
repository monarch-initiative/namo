      These equivalent identifiers may come from different databases, ontologies,
      or naming conventions, but they all refer to the same underlying concept or
      entity. This attribute is particularly useful in data integration and interoperability
      scenarios, where it is important to recognize and link different representations
      of the same entity across various sources.

    comments:
    - Note there is also a predicate 'in taxon' that can be used to instantiate an
      edge between a taxon entity and a thing with taxon entity.  This is an acceptable
      practice for KG construction, but for many applications it is more convenient
      to use this property slot to directly annotate the taxon on the entity itself.

      Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database
      this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be
      a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values
      for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would
      have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`.
      In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can
      be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific
      than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type
      assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than
      anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,
      biolink:NamedThing}
