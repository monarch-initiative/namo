description: >-
  A two-dimensional co-culture system containing primary human neurons and 
  astrocytes to model neuron-glial interactions and assess neurotoxicity of 
  environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The model maintains physiological 
  ratios of cell types and demonstrates synaptic activity for mechanistic 
  neurotoxicity studies.
