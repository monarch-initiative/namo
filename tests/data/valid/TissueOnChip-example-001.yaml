name: "Blood-Brain Barrier Tissue Chip"
description: >-
  A microfluidic tissue-on-chip model that recreates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
  using human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. 
  The model features physiological shear stress, tight junction formation, and 
  selective permeability for drug transport studies.
