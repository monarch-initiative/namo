description: >-
  A 3D intestinal organoid derived from human intestinal stem cells that 
  recapitulates the architecture and function of the small intestine. 
  Contains crypt-villus structures with stem cells, Paneth cells, 
  enterocytes, and goblet cells. Exhibits barrier function, nutrient 
  absorption, and antimicrobial peptide secretion.

differentiation_method: >-
  Intestinal stem cells are embedded in Matrigel and cultured in 
  IntestiCult medium containing Wnt3a, R-spondin1, Noggin, and EGF. 
  Organoids develop crypt-villus architecture through self-organization 
  over 5-7 days.
culture_system: >-
  Matrigel dome culture in 24-well plates with IntestiCult Organoid 
  Growth Medium. Cultures maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2, passaged 
  every 7-10 days by mechanical dissociation.
