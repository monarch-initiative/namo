description: >-
  A 3D kidney organoid derived from human pluripotent stem cells that recapitulates 
  key aspects of human kidney development and function. The organoid contains podocytes, 
  proximal tubule cells, distal tubule cells, and endothelial cells organized in 
  nephron-like structures. Used for nephrotoxicity screening and modeling acute 
  kidney injury, particularly cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

differentiation_method: >-
  Protocol based on developmental kidney organogenesis using sequential growth 
  factor treatment including activating canonical Wnt signaling, followed by 
  FGF9 and BMP signaling to induce metanephric mesenchyme and nephron progenitors.
culture_system: >-
  Suspension culture in ultra-low attachment plates with nephron differentiation 
  medium. Organoids maintained for 18-25 days with medium changes every 2-3 days 
  to allow full nephron maturation.
