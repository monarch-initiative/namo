description: >-
  A 3D cardiac organoid derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells that 
  recapitulates key aspects of human heart development and function. The organoid 
  contains cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and endothelial cells organized 
  in chamber-like structures with spontaneous contractile activity. Used for 
  cardiotoxicity screening, particularly doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy 
  and drug safety assessment.

differentiation_method: >-
  Cardiac differentiation protocol using temporal modulation of Wnt signaling 
  with CHIR99021 and IWP2, followed by metabolic selection with lactate medium 
  to enrich for cardiomyocytes. Self-assembly into 3D organoids through 
  hanging drop aggregation.
culture_system: >-
  Hanging drop culture followed by suspension culture in cardiac differentiation 
  medium. Organoids maintained for 14-21 days with regular medium changes and 
  monitoring of spontaneous contractile activity.
