name: "Deep Learning Cardiotoxicity Prediction Model"
description: >-
  A deep neural network model for predicting cardiotoxicity from chemical structure 
  and molecular descriptors. The model uses transfer learning from large chemical 
  databases and incorporates multiple endpoints including QT prolongation, 
  arrhythmia risk, and cardiomyocyte viability. Designed for early-stage 
  drug development and regulatory safety assessment.
