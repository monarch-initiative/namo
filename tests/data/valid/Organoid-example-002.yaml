name: "Hepatic Organoid Model"
description: >-
  A liver organoid system derived from human hepatocytes and cholangiocytes 
  that recapitulates key hepatic functions including albumin production, 
  urea synthesis, and cytochrome P450 metabolism. The organoid maintains 
  hepatocyte polarity and bile canaliculi formation, making it suitable 
  for drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity studies.

differentiation_method: >-
  Co-culture of primary hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in hepatocyte 
  culture medium supplemented with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and 
  epidermal growth factor (EGF). Organoids form through self-organization 
  over 7-10 days.
culture_system: >-
  Low-attachment plates with hepatocyte organoid medium containing 
  Wnt3a, R-spondin, and Noggin. Cultures maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 
  and medium changed every 2-3 days.
