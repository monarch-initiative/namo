name: "Smoking COPD Airway-on-Chip"
description: >-
  A smoking airway-on-chip model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
  research. Contains living human small-airway epithelium from healthy or COPD donors 
  cultured at air-liquid interface, coupled to a mechanical respirator that breathes 
  whole cigarette smoke in and out. The model demonstrates COPD-specific pathological 
  changes including ciliary dysfunction, micropathologies, and distinct molecular 
  signatures matching those seen in COPD patient airways. Also captures inflammatory 
  cytokine release and tissue-level damage responses under smoke exposure, providing 
  molecular, cellular, and tissue-level analysis capabilities.
