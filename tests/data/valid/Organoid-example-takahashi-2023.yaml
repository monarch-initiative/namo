description: >-
  Human intestinal organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells
  using cost-reduction strategies for high-throughput drug cytotoxicity
  screening. Features collagen gel matrix and conditioned medium to
  reduce culture costs while maintaining physiological relevance for
  drug absorption and metabolism studies.

differentiation_method: >-
  Multi-step endoderm and intestinal lineage induction from human iPS cells.
  Initial endoderm differentiation followed by intestinal specification
  using growth factors in defined medium conditions. Cost-reduced protocol
  utilizing L-WRNH conditioned medium and collagen gel matrix instead of
  expensive Matrigel.
culture_system: >-
  Cost-reduced culture system using type I collagen gel instead of Matrigel.
  Advanced DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with L-WRNH conditioned medium
  to reduce growth factor costs. Organoids maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2
  incubator with medium changes every 2-3 days and passaging every 6-7 days.
