description: >-
  A 3D brain organoid derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
  that recapitulates key aspects of early human brain development. The organoid 
  contains neural progenitor cells, mature neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes 
  organized in cortical-like structures with defined layers. Used for modeling 
  neurodevelopmental disorders and drug screening.

differentiation_method: >-
  Dual SMAD inhibition protocol with LDN193189 and SB431542 followed by 
  neural induction using N2B27 medium. Organoids are generated using 
  hanging drop method followed by embedding in Matrigel droplets.
culture_system: >-
  Matrigel dome culture with orbital shaking at 80 rpm. Organoids are 
  maintained in neural differentiation medium with regular feeding every 
  3-4 days for up to 60 days.
