description: >-
  A three-dimensional brain organoid derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells 
  that recapitulates early human brain development and neural circuit formation. 
  The organoid contains multiple brain cell types including neurons, astrocytes, 
  oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Used for developmental neurotoxicity testing, 
  organoid intelligence research, and screening environmental chemicals for 
  neurodevelopmental effects.

differentiation_method: >-
  Dual SMAD inhibition protocol using Dorsomorphin and SB431542 to promote neural 
  induction, followed by 3D aggregation and long-term culture with growth factors 
  to promote regional specification and maturation. Organoids cultured for 60-120 days 
  to achieve neural network formation.
culture_system: >-
  Spinner flask culture with neural differentiation medium containing BDNF, GDNF, 
  and other neurotrophic factors. Organoids maintained in controlled oxygen environment 
  (5% O2) to prevent oxidative stress and support physiological development.
