differentiation_method: Multi-step endoderm and intestinal lineage induction from
  human iPS cells. Initial endoderm differentiation followed by intestinal specification
  using growth factors in defined medium conditions. Cost-reduced protocol utilizing
  L-WRNH conditioned medium and collagen gel matrix instead of expensive Matrigel.
culture_system: Cost-reduced culture system using type I collagen gel instead of Matrigel.
  Advanced DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with L-WRNH conditioned medium to reduce growth
  factor costs. Organoids maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator with medium changes
  every 2-3 days and passaging every 6-7 days.
